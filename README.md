# DOS Floppy Imaging

Some "works on my machine" script(s) for converting an folder full of [SuperCard Pro](https://www.cbmstuff.com/proddetail.php?prod=SCP) flux images into folders/zipfiles.

Currently depends on a [macOS build](https://simonowen.com/samdisk/samdisk-388-osx.zip) of the [SAMdisk](https://simonowen.com/samdisk/) utility for the SCP to disk image conversion, as well as Apple's builtin `hdiutil` for mounting the resulting disks.
